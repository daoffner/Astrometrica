/* Heavily modified version of method from chapter 35 of Meeus' _Astronomical
Algorithms_,  "Near-Parabolic Motion",  which describes a method due to
Werner Landgraf.  WARNING:  this was of intellectual interest.  As will
be described,  I don't see this method as being practically useful,  even
with the enhancements I've made.

   Specifically,  I modified the way in which (35.1) is solved.  That
equation,  rearranged slightly and using 'y' for 'gamma', reads

f(s) = Qt - s - (1-2y)s^3/3 + y(2-3y)s^5/5 - y^2(3-4y)s^7/7 + ....

   ...and we need to do a root-finding such that f(s) = 0.   Meeus
suggests a pretty simple root-finder that has some convergence issues.
In the following,  Newton-Raphson is used.  Fortunately, it's quite easy
to compute f(s) and f'(s) at the same time.

   I also noticed that the above series will diverge for s > 1/sqrt(|y|),
and as you approach that limit,  convergence will be absurdly slow.
And there's no way around _that_ convergence issue.  Which is why I don't
see this method as being actually useful;  it's slow and doesn't always
work.  Maybe it was once useful,  long ago (pre-1985 or so)  on machines
without built-in math coprocessors to handle trig functions?         */
