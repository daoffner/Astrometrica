/* Test routine for get_time_from_string().  This function is supposed
to puzzle out a huge range of bizarre inputs,  such as "March 4" (fourth
day of March) vs. "4 Mar" and so on.  'get_test.txt' contains some example
inputs;  'get_test' reads those inputs,  prints out the resulting times,
and you can then check to make sure that the approved output resulted
by comparing it to 'get_test.out'.        */
