   The format of these orbits is that of the Minor Planet Center's
MPCORB dataset. Each object's elements are stored on a single line,
the format of which is described at:

          http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/info/MPOrbitFormat.html

   Note that certain parameters such as the number of oppositions and
internal MPC data are replaced in the following with spaces or asterisks.
Also note that this is a lousy format for objects with large semimajor
axes,  because the precision of the mean anomaly drops.  Also,  this
format cannot handle parabolic or hyperbolic orbits at all.  I expect to
repair these problems with an extension,  wherein the mean anomaly and
mean motion are replaced with the JD of periapsis,  and the semimajor
axis is replaced by the perihelion distance.  (With possibly further
modifications to allow for non-heliocentric orbits.)  Unfortunately,
this will not be readable with most existing software.

   Also,  be advised that more verbose elements,  including such data
as state vectors and MOIDs with all major planets (and JD of periapsis
and perihelion distance)  are written to the file 'state.txt'.
