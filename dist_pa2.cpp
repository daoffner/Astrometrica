/*
   NOTE that this version is deprecated.  I strongly suggest using
'dist_pa.cpp' instead.  In this older version,  the same problems are
tackled using classical spherical trigonometric methods.  That turns
out to be excessively complicated and prone to lots of "corner cases"
wherein precision is lost.  The 'dist_pa.cpp' is a lot simpler and
more precise.

   calc_dist_and_posn_ang() takes two RA/dec points,  and computes their
angular separation and position angle.  If you don't want the PA,  pass
in NULL for the posn_ang argument.

   After a quick check to make sure p1 != p2,  the code uses a haversine
method to get the distance.  This handles small angles correctly.  The
"usual" formula for such a spherical triangle,

cos(a) = cos(b) * cos(c) + sin(b) * sin(c) * cos( alpha)

   has serious precision problems when cos(a) is close to +/-1 (a=0 or
180 degrees).  Instead,  the haversine formula mentioned in Meeus'
_Astronomical Algorithms_,  page 111,  is used:  (use a fixed-size
font to read the following equations:)

hav( dist) = hav( dec1 - dec2) + cos( dec1) * cos( dec2) * hav( delta_ra)

   A quick review of haversines:  it helps to know that if

                     2
x = hav( theta) = sin ( theta / 2) = (1 - cos( theta) / 2)

   then the "inverse haversine" is computed as

theta = inv_haversine( x) = 2 * arcsine( sqrt( x))

   Once it has the distance,  getting the PA is just about trivial,  and
is again done using haversines,  using the spherical triangle formula

   2                              cos( b - c) - cos( a)
sin ( alpha / 2) = hav( alpha) = -----------------------
                                    2 sin( b) sin( c)

   ...which,  after setting b = 90 - dec1, c = dist, a = 90 - dec2,
alpha = PA (from point 1 to point 2),  gives

            sin( dec1 + dist) - sin( dec2)
hav( PA) = --------------------------------
                 2 cos( dec1) sin( dist)

   In using this,  the code first makes sure that sin(b) * sin(c) isn't
zero (which could happen if the points are superimposed, making dist=0, or
if the starting point is at the pole,  dec1 = +/- 90... in either case,
the PA is undefined).  After doing the division,  it makes sure the result
is <= 1;  mathematically,  it never will be, but roundoff happens.

   The resulting PA lies between 0 and 180,  because the above formula
can't distinguish east from west.  So we do a check of sin( ra1 - ra2)
to fix that.

   (14 Nov 2005)  John Greaves pointed out that the position error
reported using this function is undefined in some cases where the
position angle is zero.  I now see that if PA=0,  then dec1 + dist = dec2
and in the above haversine formula for the position angle,  we're
subtracting identical quantities.  And if there's roundoff (there is
always roundoff),  you might get a negative haversine,  and a square
root error.  So we now check to make sure the value isn't less than zero,
as well as making sure it's less than or equal to one.

   Ideally,  we might make use of the fact that for nearly identical
angles a and b,  it's best to express the difference in their sines
as

sin(a) - sin(b) = sin( (a+b)/2) * cos((a-b)/2)
