   In computing planetary/lunar/asteroid positions,  there are
several odd things that need to be done.  First,  you have to
account for the fact that three different time scales are in
use.  "UT" (Universal Time) corresponds to the "usual" concept
of time as being linked to the earth's rotation;  noon UT is
expected to match up with when the sun (on average) is highest
in the sky as seen from Greenwich,  England.  "TD" (Temps
Dynamic,  or Dynamical Time) corresponds to a physicist's idea
of time:  time as measured by an atomic clock.  Since the
earth's rotation isn't perfectly uniform,  there is a varying
difference between TD and UT,  known as "Delta-T".  (It's
currently about 70 seconds,  and increasing.)

   "UTC" (Coordinated Universal Time) is something of an hybrid.
The lengths of seconds are determined by atomic clocks.  When
the clocks don't quite line up with the earth's rotation (which
is inevitable because the clocks represent a "uniform" flow of
time,  but the earth's rotation is irregular),  a "leap second"
is inserted.  Strange as it may seem,  the last day of December
or June is sometimes one second longer than other days,  in order
to ensure that UTC stays within .9 seconds of UT (i.e.,  within
.9 seconds of the earth's rotation).  Because the rotation really
is irregular,  you can't tell very far in advance when a leap
second will be inserted;  you usually get about six months of
warning.

   Anyway.  The upshot of all this is that we need to handle
UTC,  because that's what the user will usually "think" in;
it's assumed that a UTC time will be given to this program.
We also need to know UT,  because that corresponds to the earth's
rotation;  and we need to know how much the earth has rotated
in order to compute where the observer,  on the surface of the
earth,  is positioned relative to the geocenter.  And finally,
we need to know TD,  because that is the "uniformly flowing"
time scale best suited to planetary and lunar ephemerides.

   (Note that a purist would turn pale at the brief history
of time systems given above.  I've omitted lots of nuances for
the sake of clarity.)

   Anyway.  The next odd thing we need to consider is that PS1996
(the theory used to compute planetary positions) gives the
coordinates of the Earth/Moon barycenter (EMB),  rather than those
of the Earth.  (JPL ephemerides do the same thing.  VSOP comes with
"Earth center" series and "EMB" series.)  Using EMB is actually a
pretty reasonable thing to do.  The EMB moves along in a fairly
smooth and continuous manner.  The earth's center wobbles around
the EMB once a month,  resulting in more complicated motion and a
longer series of coefficients.

   To get around this,  the code computes both the EMB position
and the earth-moon vector.  (The latter isn't part of PS1996;
it's computed using the separate ELP-82 theory.)  That lets us
"adjust" the EMB position,  after which we've a good handle on
where the center of the earth is.

   However,  one is often more interested in where an observer, on the
center of the earth,  happens to be. 'compute_topocentric_offset()'
figures out the vector between the earth's center and an observer at a
specified lat/lon and altitude above the geoid.

   Next,  we compute the position of the target planet.  Then
we hit a small snag:  the speed of light is finite,  so what
we really need is to know where it was back when the light left
the planet and headed our way.  So if we find that Jupiter,  for
example,  was 4.5 AU away,  we divide the distance by the speed
of light and then say,  "OK... where was Jupiter that much
earlier (about 37 minutes)?"  After a couple of iterations
(this code does three,  which is probably one more than is
really needed),  we have a good position for the target planet.

   Subtract the (heliocentric) Earth vector from the (heliocentric)
planet vector,  and you've a good Earth-to-planet vector. You can
then take that vector,  convert to polar coordinates,  and show an
RA/dec (as is done in the 'make_ra_dec_string' function.)

   At this point,  you may be done.  You have a topocentric position
in the J2000,  or ICRF,  frame of reference. (Purists will point out
that J2000 isn't exactly the same as ICRF, but it's close enough for
current purposes.)  This is the position in a system that is lined
up with distant quasars and corresponds to a physicist's concept of
an inertial frame of reference:  one whose axes are fixed.  If you
looked up a position on a star chart,  this is the coordinate system
you would use.

   However,  you may need "apparent coordinates",  in which the
axes are defined by the earth's rotation.  Since the earth wobbles
due to precession and nutation,  the axes used for apparent coordinates
wobble as well;  and one needs to account for the effects of the
aberration of light as well.  All that is outside the scope of this
little demo program (though routines for precession,  nutation,  and
aberration are part of this library).   */
