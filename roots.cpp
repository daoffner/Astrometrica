/* Code to find all real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients.
Used in 'gauss.cpp' to get solutions to the equation of Lagrange:

   x^8 + a * x^6 + b * x ^ 3 + c = 0

   and in 'sr.cpp' to solve a particular sixth-degree polynomial used
in figuring out how far away an object might be.  But it could be used
for any polynomial with real coefficients.  It's awkward code,  but
has the virtue of finding _all_ real roots, including double roots and
closely-paired roots that might be neglected by other methods.  (Such
close pairs of solutions are common in the equation of Lagrange.)

   Its other virtue is that finding all real roots is guaranteed,  at
least in mathematical theory and in my experience (I can't rule out
the possibility that some sort of roundoff issue,  for example,  might
come out and savage you.)  For my purposes,  this was very important;
I needed "it always works,  no matter what" more than "it's very fast,
but sometimes fails."

   It's currently limited to polynomials of degree less than ten.
Redefine MAX_POLY_ORDER if this is a problem.

   It works via a recursive process:  it finds the real roots of the
_derivative_ of the polynomial.  (Therefore,  if you call this function
with an eighth-degree polynomial,  it will internally generate the
seventh-degree derivative polynomial,  find the real roots of that,
which will mean finding the roots of a sixth-degree polynomial, and so
on. As you'll see,  this eventually works down to a first-degree
polynomial, a.k.a. a linear equation,  which is trivially solved without
recursion.)

   Anyway,  the "real roots of the derivative of the polynomial" are also
known as the minima/maxima of the polynomial.  We can know as a fact that
all real roots of the polynomial lie between these maxima/minima.  So the
code evaluates the polynomial at each maximum/minimum;  if its value goes
through a sign change between consecutive maxima/minima, we've got a root
bracketed and can use find_poly_root_between() to nail it down precisely
with the method of Laguerre.

   One odd thing has to be done here,  though.  There are maxima/minima
at +/- infinity,  too.  So if we find,  say,  three minima at x1, x2, x3,
then there may be roots between (x1, x2) and (x2, x3), plus roots between
-inf and x1 and between x3 and +inf.  Since an infinite limit is awkward,
we find a limit on the possible magnitude of all roots, due to Cauchy
(see below).  (Plus another limit I came up with,  which turned out to be
a "rediscovery" of a limit from Donald Knuth's _The Art of Programming_.
Knuth's limit is frequently smaller than Cauchy's... but not always,  so
it pays to check them both.)  In general, if we find N minima/maxima,
there will be N+1 ranges to search.

   One other small improvement has been made:  zero roots are factored out
up front.  At least for use here,  such roots are extremely common, since
the equation of Lagrange has lots of zero coefficients (five out of nine).

   Another small improvement would be to note that,  if the polynomial is
of odd degree or the constant and leading terms are of opposite sign,  we
can bracket and remove a root quite readily,  then work on a polynomial
of lesser degree.  I've started on this.  I may not bother finishing it,
because the code is plenty fast enough for my needs at present;  the
slight loss of precision inherent in removing roots this way is more
worrisome than the slight gain in speed. */

/* find_poly_root_between() looks for a zero of a polynomial between
two bracketing points.  It starts with a linear interpolation between
the initial two points,  then uses the method of Laguerre to find the
actual root.  If the Laguerre iteration fails due to a negative square
root,  we do a Newton-Raphson step (we've already computed the first
derivative anyway).  If the Laguerre or N-R step would put us outside
the bracketing points,  we reject it and do bisection instead.

   Laguerre is noted for almost always finding a root briskly.  If it
goes past 'max_iterations',  it's probably failing to converge,  and
we switch to bisecting on every other step.  A few bisections will
probably nudge us off the problem region,  resulting in speedy
convergence.  If it doesn't reinstate convergence,  it'll still
converge with worst-case linear performance.  I've never actually seen
Laguerre fail,  except when testing with a low 'max_iterations' value,
but it's theoretically possible.  The use of this bisection code ensures
decent worst case behavior.

   If x1 < 0 and x2 > 0,  then the bracket contains x=0,  and we can
"compute" the polynomial at that point y(0) = poly[0] trivially, and
then adjust the brackets accordingly.  The following code uses this
little trick to get a slight boost in performance.

   It's almost as simple to compute the value of the polynomial at x=1
(just add all the coefficients) and at x=-1 (add all even coeffs,  subtract
all the odd ones),  and I gave this a try.  It does help a little,  and
might be worthwhile in some situations,  but I ended up commenting it out
with #ifdef PROBABLY_NOT_WORTHWHILE.            */
