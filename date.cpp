/* General calendrical comments:

This code supports conversions between JD and eight calendrical systems:
Julian,  Gregorian,  Hebrew,  Islamic,  Jalaali (Persian),  Chinese,
(French) revolutionary,  and Modern Persian.  Comments pertaining to
specific calendars are found near the code for those calendars.

    For each calendar,  there is a "get_(calendar_name)_year_data( )"
function, used only within this source code. This function takes a particular
year number,  and computes the JD corresponding to "new years day" (first day
of the first month) in that calendar in that year.  It also figures out the
number of days in each month of that year,  returned in the array
month_data[].  There can be up to 13 months,  because the Hebrew and Chinese
calendars can include an "intercalary month";  also,  the five or six extra
days at the end of the French Revolutionary calendar are considered as "the
thirteenth month" in this code.

   If a month doesn't exist,  then the month_data[] entry for it will be zero.
 Thus,  in the Gregorian and Julian and Islamic calendars, month_data[12] is
always zero,  since these calendars have only 12 months. The same will happen
in Chinese and Hebrew years that lack intercalary months,  meaning about 63%
of the time.  So far,  all calendars involve twelve or thirteen months.
(Some involve more;  the Baha'i calendar,  for example,  involves 19,  and
the Celtic "year-and-a-day" calendar involves 13 months of 28 days plus one
or two leftover days that would be treated as a fourteenth month.  If the
code is ever revised to handle this,  N_MONTHS will have to be re-defined,
and other changes probably made.)

The next level up is the get_calendar_data( ) function,  which (through
the wonders of a switch statement) can get the JD of New Years Day and
the array of months for any given year for any calendar.  Above this
point,  all calendars can be treated in a common way;  one is shielded
from the oddities of individual calendrical systems.  The
get_calendar_data( ) function is still local to this file.

Finally,  at the top level,  we reach the only two functions that are
exported for the rest of the world to use:  dmy_to_day( ) and day_to_dmy( ).
The first takes a day,  month,  year,  and calendar system.  It calls
get_calendar_data( ) for the given year,  adds in the days in the months
intervening New Years Day and the desired month,  and adds in the day
of the month,  and returns the resulting Julian Day.

day_to_dmy( ) reverses this process.  It finds an "approximate" year
corresponding to an input JD,  and calls get_calendar_data( ) for
that year.  By adding all the month_data[] values for that year,  it
can also find the JD for the _end_ of that year;  if the input JD is
outside that range,  it may have to back up a year or add in a year.
Once it finds "JD of New Years Day < JD < JD of New Years Eve",  it's
a simple matter to track down which month and day of the month corresponds
to the input JD.

significance outside of this particular function... but it _does_ let us
write simpler code that won't get wrong answers for large or negative

The French Revolutionary calendar is simplest,  in some respects;
you just have twelve months,  each of 30 days,  with five or six
"unattached" days at the end of the year.  The only real problem
is in handling leap years.  There are no fewer than four possible
ways of doing this.

   The calendar was originally defined to have 1 Vendemiare,  "New
Years Day",  to be the date on which the autumnal equinox occurred
as seen from Paris.  It was also defined to occur once every four
years.  You can't have both,  and the contradiction was quickly
noticed and resulted in the four schemes:

   (1) Keep it matched to the autumnal equinox. In this case,  leap
years are usually four years apart but are sometimes five (similar
to the Jalaali calendar).  It also becomes an "observational" calendar;
extension into the distant future (and past) becomes difficult,
because the uncertainty in the earth's rotation means we can't be
totally sure as to the date on which the equinox will fall.  The pattern
of leap years is far from intuitively obvious (you can't just look at
a year and see if it's divisible by four).  And at the time,  computing
the date of the autumnal solstice wasn't a trivial exercise. However,
this _was_ the scheme in actual use during the short active lifetime of
this calendar, resulting in Years 3, 7, 11,  and 15 AR being leap years.

   (2) The Gregorian scheme:  leap years are those divisible by four,
except for those divisible by 100,  except for those divisible by
400.  Alternatively...

   (3) ...the same thing,  with the addition of "except for those
divisible by 4000",  something occasionally suggested for the Gregorian
calendar as well.

   (4) A scheme in which leap years are those divisible by four,
except for those divisible by 128.  This slight deviation from the
Gregorian scheme,  of "divisible by four,  unless divisible by
100,  unless divisible by 400",  is slightly simpler and gives a
calendar that is _much_ closer to the true tropical year.

   In practice,  the only real certainty appears to be that years
3, 7, 11,  and 15 were leap years.  After that,  one of the above
schemes was to be implemented,  but the calendar was abolished
before that happened.

   I really doubt the likelihood of schemes (2) and (3).  A revolution
so devoted to revising every aspect of human existence that it
changed names of all months,  "regularized" each to be 30 days,  and
made a week ten days long,  probably went out of its way not to
resemble earlier calendars proposed by a Pope.  The defects of (1)
being somewhat apparent,  my tendency is to go with the 4/128 rule.
I've found code and authors supporting all four schemes.  By default,
the following code uses the 4/128 rule,  but as you'll see,  all
four schemes can be implemented by #ifdef'fing chunks of code.

   A 'proleptic' calendar wasn't defined,  to my knowledge...
however,  "BR" (Before the Revolution) years are handled logically,
for all four schemes,  in this code.

/* Start:  Chinese calendar */

/* The Chinese calendar poses some particularly sticky problems,  and is
a real mess to compute.  Therefore,  I wrote a separate program to
"pre-compile" a calendar and store it in a file,  CHINESE.DAT.  To handle
the Chinese calendar,  one must load that file into a buffer,
chinese_calendar_data.  The following code then simply "un-crunches" the
data.

   NOTE:  The odd arrangement of intercalary months in the Chinese calendar
means that one must be careful about month numbering.  The solution I've
used in this code is to return a twelve or thirteen-month calendar,  much
as with the Chinese calendar;  the external int chinese_intercalary_month
is used to indicate which of the 13 is intercalary (it's left at zero if
there is no intercalary month.)  See JD.CPP for an example of its use.

   NOTE:  Some parts of the following code extract integer data without
proper regard to byte-order.  If you compile this on "wrong-endian"
machines,  this will have to be fixed!  (Not a big deal;  three lines,
marked below,  need changes.)

   The "packing" works as follows.  The data for each year is stored in
24 bits.  The 13 least significant bits are set (or unset) to indicate
30-day (or 29-day) months.  Shifting the "packed value" down by 13 thus
leaves an 11-bit quantity.

   That value,  modulo 14,  tells you which month in that year is the
intercalary one.  (If it's zero,  there is no intercalary month,  and
this is a twelve-month year.)  Dividing the value by 14 gives you an
"offset",  and the JD of the Chinese New Year is then given as

jd = 365 * year + year / 4 + CHINESE_CALENDAR_EPOCH + offset

Thus,  the offset can be a value from 0 to (2^11 / 14) = 186. */
