/* (6 Apr 2008) Added a "reverse" function, reverse_dist_and_posn_ang(),
which takes a point, distance, and PA, and computes the destination point.

   (19 Feb 2006)  This function to compute the distance and position
angle between two points has been completely rewritten relative to
the previous one.  It uses a very different approach intended to
evade some loss of precision problems that arose with that previous
(haversine-based) approach.

   We'll assume two points (theta1, phi1) and (theta2, phi2).  On the
Earth,  theta=lon and phi=lat;  on the sky,  theta=RA and phi=dec.
We can first subtract theta1 from both quantities so that the points
become (0, phi1) and (theta2-theta1, phi2) = (dtheta, phi2);  this
rotation by theta1 around the z-axis won't affect the distance and
position angle between the two points.

   We can then use the following spherical trig identities:

z_component = cos(dist) = cos(dtheta) * cos(phi1) * cos(phi2)
                                      + sin(phi1) * sin(phi2);
x_component = sin(dist)sin(PA) = sin(dtheta) * cos(phi2);
y_component = sin(dist)cos(PA) = sin(phi2) * cos(phi1) -
                                 sin(phi1) * cos(phi2) * cos(dtheta);

   The "component" notation came about because I first came up with this
method by thinking in terms of vectors:  in a coordinate system where
the first RA/dec coordinate points in the z-axis,  and the x-coordinate
is in the equator at right angles to this,  and the y-axis completes
the triplet,  then the second RA/dec coordinate pair has the unit vector
(x_component, y_component, z_component) in that system.  But the above
also corresponds to spherical trigonometric identities.

   Things always seem to break down for small dtheta and phi1 close to
phi2,  so I made use of trig subtraction identities to rearrange the
y and z components to read

z_component = cos( phi2 - phi1) - (1 - cos(dtheta)) * cos(phi1) * cos(phi2)
y_component = sin( phi2 - phi1) + (1 - cos(dtheta)) * sin(phi1) * cos(phi2)

   ...and we can then get the position angle right away,  as the atan2
of the x and y components (suitably moved around to satisfy the usual
conventions that PA=0 is north and so on.)

   If the z_component is between +/-.7,  we can just get the distance
as arccos( z_component).  But for small distances or distances near the
antipodes (z_component near +/- 1),  roundoff will give us grief,  and
we have to use sin( dist) = sqrt( x_component^2 + y_component^2).  Then
we check to see which quadrant we're in (i.e.,  do we have a small distance
or one near the poles?),  and we're done.

   I don't see where a loss-of-precision problem would arise with this
code.  Using the 'test function',  I see that this code remains accurate:
the original calc_dist_and_posn_ang( ) function loses precision for very
small distances and those near to 180 degrees (i.e.,  the points are at
antipodes).  In such cases,  the haversine of the position angle is
poorly rounded off,  and you get an imprecise PA and sometimes distance.
This new code appears to handle both cases with aplomb.   */
