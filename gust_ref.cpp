/* The original GUST86 code transformed Uranicentric coords to B1950.
Rather than do that,  then precess to J2000,  I wrote the snippet below
to compute the full Uranicentric-to-J2000 matrix.  Also,  the original
code did quite a bit of math to convert alf and del -- the RA and dec
of the Uranian pole in B1950 -- into a rotation matrix.  If you just
store the matrix as nine precomputed doubles,  you save yourself
some code and time and math. */
