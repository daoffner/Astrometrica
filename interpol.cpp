/* The following function performs Lagrangian interpolation through n_pts
points with x=0, 1, 2, ... n_pts-1 and y=y[0], y[1],... y[n_pts - 1],
determining the y corresponding to a given x.  It does this with the
usual Lagrangian polynomial,  of order n_pts-1,

      n_pts-1
      ____
      \
y(x) = >    y[i] poly( i, x)
      /___
       i=0


              __
poly( i, x) = || (x - j) / (i - j)
            j=0..n_pts-1,  j != i

   To see how this works,  consider what y(x) will be for x=0...n_pts-1.
poly(i, x) will be equal to zero for all i not equal to x,  and will
be equal to 1 for i=x.  So we've found an n_pts-1 order polynomial that
fits though our n_pts points.

   At first glance,  it may look as if this is an order n^2 process,
but there's a bit of trickery we can do to make it order n.  First,
if we compute

     __
C =  || (x - j)
   j=0..n_pts-1

   (note the removal of the j != i condition),  we can pull C in front
of the sigma and get

        n_pts-1
         ____
         \
y(x) = C  > y[i] / (t(i) * (x - i))
         /___
          i=0

   where

       __
t(i) = || (i - j)
      j=0..n_pts-1,  j != i

   It still looks as if we're at order n^2.  We can do either of two
things.  We can pre-compute t(i) and use it over and over,  recomputing
only when n_pts changes.  Or we can compute t(0) and then make use of
recurrence:

t(i + 1) = t(i) * i / (i - n_pts)

   ...which is the approach used below.

   Also,  note that when we computed C,  we left ourselves open to a
divide-by-zero error if x was on an abscissa.  That happens iff C=0.
So if C=0,  we just return with the abscissa value y[(int)x]. */
